- [x] Mention two parts of Express that you learned about this week.

- I learned this weak that express allows us to create     APIs in an easier way. Also it allows us to build web    services (REST) that work with json. I learned about     express main features such as middleware. 

- [x] Describe Middleware?

-  Middleware is like an array of functions that get        executed in the order they are introduced into the       server code. 

- [x] Describe a Resource? 

- Kinda hard to explain this one since we were told that   everything is a resource while designing Web API, so I   like to think about it this way; if the client is        trying to get a list of lets say movies, well that       list of movies would be that particular resource the     client is trying to get. 

- [x] What can the API return to help clients know if a request was successful?

- THe API returns a status code 200 means ok so the API should return the specific (HTTP response status codes)

- [x] How can we partition our application into sub-applications?
